# Subreddit_Predictions
Working with a collection of reddit posts to develop a model to predict the subreddit

The data is a collection of posts from reddit.com from numerous programming-focused subreddits in December 2017, along with some additional post metadata (the number of upvotes from the community, the number of comments made on the post, etc.) While reddit allows you to submit a link in place of text, this data has been subset to only self-posts (posts where the writer has submitted text instead of a link elsewhere).

This notebook walks through my approach to using natural language processing to create a model to predict the subreddit of a post from its title.
